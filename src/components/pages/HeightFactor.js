        <h1 className='heightfactor'>What determines our height</h1>
        <p className="paragraph">Our height as individuals is primarily determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetically, height is influenced by the interaction of multiple genes, with each gene contributing a small effect. These genes control the production of growth hormones, the growth plates in our bones, and other factors that affect skeletal development. Variations in these genes can result in differences in height among individuals. For example, certain gene variants may promote enhanced bone growth and taller stature, while others may limit growth potential.</p>
        <p className="paragraph">Environmental factors also play a role in determining our height. Adequate nutrition during childhood and adolescence is crucial for optimal growth. A balanced diet that provides essential nutrients, particularly protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other vitamins and minerals, is important for healthy bone development. Malnutrition or insufficient nutrient intake during these critical periods can lead to stunted growth. Additionally, various health conditions, such as hormonal imbalances or chronic diseases, can affect growth and result in shorter stature.</p>
